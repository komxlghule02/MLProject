# Parkinson disease detection using spiral images
This repository provides a machine learning pipeline to detect Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using hand‑drawn spiral images. A CNN model is trained to distinguish between spirals drawn by PD-affected individuals and healthy controls, enabling early, non-invasive and cost-effective screening.
# Key Findings
Spiral drawings of PD patients typically show irregularities, tremor-induced noise, and distortion in shape.
CNN-based classification on spiral images can reach high accuracy, especially when data augmentation and architecture tuning are used 
Transfer learning approaches (e.g. VGG‑19 or ResNets) have achieved accuracies up to ~96.7% on small PD handwriting datasets
